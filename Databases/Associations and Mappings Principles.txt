Associations / Mapping Relationship Principles in SQL. 



Parent-Child + Ownership: 

---> Conceptually, entities A and B are in a relationship and the following terms describe them based on which one has the foreign key: 

	A. Parent entity => This is the entity that owns the primary key being referred to in the foreign key of the other entity. 

	B. Child entity => This is the entity that owns the foreign key referring to the primary key. 

	C. Owner => The "owner" of the relationship is the owner of the foreign key in the relationship. 

	---> Important: The child entity and the owner are the same thing in the context of related / associated entities. 

	---> The labels of these terms are important in defining how mappings are configured in ORM contexts between entity classes. 




One-To-Many relationships: 

---> A one-to-many relationship specifies the number of one entity in relation to another entity. 

	---> Conceptually, this type of mapping shows that one entity can be related in some way to many other entities. 

	---> Practically, this is defined as a concept of ownership between the 2 entities. 

		---> The entity that is on the "many" side of the one-to-many relationship owns the foreign key of the "one" entity. 

		---> This means that the many entity contains the foreign key in the relationship, which maintains the reference between the 2 entities.
