MySQL Syntax Basics for DDL 



DDL: Creating a table. 

---> The CREATE keyword is used to create a table as follows: 


	
	---> The generalized format is as follows => 

	CREATE table tableName(
		columnName dataType fieldAttributes..., 
		...
		constraints...
		...
		PRIMARY KEY (columnName)
	);

	---> The CREATE is a DDL reserved keyword and table is an object word used to describe the type of object being created. 

	---> A list of column name, data type and field attributes is required for the "under the hood" function that creates the table. 

		---> The field attributes are used to define aspects of the column, such as non nullability and auto-incrementing. 

		---> Multiple field attributes can specified after the data type in order to allow for customization of the column properties. 

		---> After the columns are defined, any constraints on the table can be defined. 

		---> Finally, a primary key must always be defined in order to uniquely identify records / rows in the table. 


	---> An applied example is given below: 

	
	create table tutorials_tbl(
   		tutorial_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  		tutorial_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
   		tutorial_author VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
   		submission_date DATE,
   		PRIMARY KEY ( tutorial_id )
	);



DDL: Alter statements. 

---> The ALTER statement can be used to alter the table and its columns in some way in MySQL. 

---> The general syntax for the ALTER statement is as follows: 

	ALTER TABLE tbl_name
    	...Do something...

	---> This DDL statement is very versatile as there are many ways in which a table can be altered in SQL. 

	---> There are 4 main ALTER statements that can be made: 


		1. Adding a new column to a table: 
			
			ALTER TABLE table_name
  			ADD new_column_name column_definition
    			[ FIRST | AFTER column_name ];
	
		
		2. Modifying a column and its column definition: 

			ALTER TABLE table_name
  			MODIFY column_name column_definition
    			[ FIRST | AFTER column_name ];


		3. Deleting a column from a table: 

			ALTER TABLE table_name
  			DROP COLUMN column_name;


		4. Renaming a column in a table: 

			ALTER TABLE table_name
  			CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name 
    			column_definition
    			[ FIRST | AFTER column_name ];


		---> These 4 column altering operations are the main uses of the alter statement. 

		---> Common features: 

			---> Using keywords such as ADD, MODIFY, DROP, CHANGE, etc in order to perform the operations on the column.
