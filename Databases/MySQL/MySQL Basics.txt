MySQL Basics. 


Existence of Databases on a computer: 

---> A database is hosted at a localhost port and so will not need to be located in the same working directory as a project. 

---> Therefore, an ORM only needs to scan for data source instances that exist on the localhost ports. 



MySQL Work Bench: 

---> This is a GUI application that is used to work directly with MySQL in a graphical way. 




MySQL Shell: 

---> This is used to directly talk to the MySQL server.  

---> The shell has 3 different modes: 

	1. SQL mode 

	2. JS mode 

	3. Python mode

	---> Being in one of those modes allows the syntax of that language to be used for it.  

	---> To switch to SQL mode, the command \sql must be used.
