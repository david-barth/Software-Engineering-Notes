Swagger Theory and Practice 1: Integration and Basic Concepts




Introduction: Basic Building Blocks

---> Swagger is a toolset that can be used to generate interactive documentation of REST APIs. 

---> Swagger consists of the following 3 components: 

	A. The OpenAPI definition

	B. Swagger UI 

	C. Swagger Codegen


---> Through use of the OpenAPI definition and Swagger UI, it is possible to generate the documentation noted above. 

	---> Swagger generates a JSON representation of the documentation that describes the REST API it is covering. 

	---> This JSON representation is accessible by the following endpoint: http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs

	---> This JSON representation is consumed by a frontend client that presents the documentation as UI (generated by Swagger UI).

	---> The URL for accessing this is: http://{Base URL}/swagger-ui/ 

		---> In the case of localhost, this is: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

		---> Note: The ending / must be included unless specialized configuration is given. 


---> Swagger Codegen allows for the generation of certain pieces of code such as HTTP client code, models, and more. 

---> Each of these are explored in turn. 



Introduction: OpenAPI Definition. 

---> The OpenAPI definition is a JSON or YAML file that is used to describe the RESTful API that is being implemented. 

---> OpenAPI itself is a language agnostic interface that is machine and human readable.

	---> This allows the capabilities of a service to be understood without thorough inspection of source code, documentation or network traffic inspection. 


---> In JSON format, the file can be obtained as follows: 

	1. Get the JSON response from http://{Base URL}/v2/api-docs

	2. Save the file as a .json file under an appropriate package, such as resources. 

	3. Use the file for purposes such as Swagger codegen. 


Introduction: Swagger UI. 

---> Swagger UI is a collection of HTML, JS, and CSS assets that allows for the interactive documentation to be generated. 

---> The documentation is effectively a static resource that is served from a URL, which can be chosen from application startup. 

---> The documnetation provides easy access to the following basic pieces of information: 

	A. API contracts 

	B. Endpoints

	C. Data models 



Introduction: Swagger Codegen. 

---> Swagger Codegen is a Java application that can use the OpenAPI JSON / YAML document to generate HTTP client SDKs in various langauges. 

---> Client Codegen allows for the HTTP clients to be generated for easy use in various parts of a service (e.g. tests) or in consumers of the service.  

---> Codegen can be configured to run via commandline, Gradle, or Maven.
