Tasks to be defined in the future: 

	1. Adding logging to the backend with associated error handling. 

		---> Reason => The tomcat server does not report on various interactions of the backend when external requests come in. 

			---> Look into Spring Actuator (?) 



	2. Add scanning of the data source to the property files.  

		---> Reason => When the app is built onto its deployed environment, it should be able to perfomr a necessary connection to its data source. 



	3. Add DDL and DML scripts to resource section in order to initialize with tables if necessary. 

		---> Reason => Moslty for archetype deployment purposes.

			---> More context is needed to define if this is really needed. 


	4. Encryption of key information is needed. 

		---> Reason => Good for security purposes related ot the app.
