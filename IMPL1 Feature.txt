Feature 1 Proposal: Ordering a crypto-currency Quote. 


---> Idea => Create an instant quote of either a specified crypto currency or a list of crypto currencies. 

	---> Data is to be gathered from a cryptocurrency API in order to construct the quote information. 

	---> This data can then be gathered from the backend and transformed to an appropriate quote object format before being sent to the frontend.


---> Extensions => The quote can be stored in the MySQL database and be accessed in order to compare quotes on different occasions. 

---> Chosen API for data => https://messari.io/api/docs


---> Data to include in a basic cryptocurrency quote: 

	---> Ticker Symbol

	---> Current market price

	---> Market cap

	---> Change in market price in the last 24 hours

	---> Real Volume 

	---> All time high (by year?) 

	---> All time high date

	---> Token Type

	---> Genesis Block Date 

	---> Precise Consensus Algorithm

 
---> Secret Key => e067e272-c6da-4fc5-b381-ba448cc84187


---> Specific Planning: 

	1. One call to the following endpoint:  https://data.messari.io/api/v1/assets/{TickerSymbol}/metrics

	2. One call to the following endpoint: https://data.messari.io/api/v1/assets/{TickerSymbol}/metrics/market-data

	3. Figure out workflow for making a REST call to an external service. 

		A. How to make a REST call in Spring MVC specifically

		B. What is the specific flow of classes through the layer 

		C. How to structure a domain driven design directory structure

		D. What are the ideal ways to transform the data
