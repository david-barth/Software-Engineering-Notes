Theory 2: OSI and TCP/IP Models. 

---> Networking can be rationalized in terms of 2 main models. 


	A. OSI => This stands for the Open Systems Interconnection model. The 7 layers are: 

		1. Application

		2. Presentation

		3. Session

		4. Transport

		5. Network

		6. Data Link

		7. Physical  

		---> Traditionally, the OSI model is considered to be too theoretical to be of practical use. 


	B. TCP/IP => This model consists of 5 layers: 


		1. Application
	
		2. Transport

		3. Network

		4. Data Link

		5. Physical 

		---> In the TCP/IP model the Application layer wraps up the OSI Session, Presentation, and Application layers into a single layer. 

		---> The TCP/IP model is the more practically considered model between the two models defined here. 

		---> The network communication protocols supported by the TCP/IP model are as follows: 

			1. IPv4 =>  Internet Protocol Version 4

			2. TCP => Transmission Control Protocol 

			3. UDP => User Datagram Protocol

			4. IPv6 => Internet Protocol Version 6

			---> These are all on the Transport layer of the TCP/IP.


---> Overall, the models represent a separation of concerns among the different levels of complexity that comes computer networking. 

	---> The Application, Network, and Transport layers have direct relevance to software engineering to differing extents.



---> Reminder: A communication protocol defines a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information. 

	---> The protocol essentially defines rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication when communication is done over a network. 

	---> A protocol also defines possible erorr recovery methods. 



TCP/IP: Bits, Frames, Packets, and Segments. 

---> The forms that data is transmitted in can also be considered in terms of the layers of the TCP/IP model. 

---> The following forms of data are considered at each layer: 


	A. Application => Applications 

	B. Transport => Segments

	C. Network => Packets

	D. Data Link => Frames -> A frame represents a "frame" of bits being switched between two ports in a switch. 

	E. Physical => Bits -> On the physical layer, electrical binary states are represented by 1/0 states. This is the simplest representation.


---> Packets and segments will be defined later in more theoretical detail. 

---> Important => Issues usually propagate from the top level of the Application down to the lower levels. 

	---> Ie the Application layer is what can cause the most problems for the lower levels of the network.
