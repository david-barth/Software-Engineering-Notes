Theory 10: Routers and Routing.



Introduction to Routing and Routers: 

---> A router is an OSI layer 3 device that routes traffic between different networks (e.g. LANs) using IP addresses and routing protocols.                             

	---> A router uses intelligent decisions, via routing protocols, to find the best way to get a packet of information from on enetwork to another.             

	---> A router also allows for broadcast domains to be broken up into smaller pieces, allowing for collisions to be avoided. 


---> The simplified process for routing is given below: 

	1. A client device creates a packet destined for PC2 with the following IP address: 

		A. Source IP 

		B. Destination IP

	
	2.  The packet is sent to the client's default gateway, which is the Ethernet interface of its associated router. 

		---> If the router's MAC address is not known, this can be found out via an ARP request which resolves the MAC address from the IP address of the router. 


	3.  The router will then inspect the destination IP address and make a routing decision based on its routing table in order to identify which route to send it to. 

		---> The routing table can contain connections to other routers and also to direcly connected devices in the LAN. 

		---> The table will contain the router IP addresses that resolve to the fastest path and this will be how the router decides on the route path determination. 


	4.   The packet will be sent on the chosen route via a serial connection (for WAN) and not an ethernet connection (for LANs). 

		---> If intermediary routers exist, then the packet will be sent continously along the fastest available path based on the IP addresses in the routing tables of the intermediary routers.  


	5.   Upon reception of the packet, the destination router will check to see if the direct ethernet connections in its routing tables correspond to the destination IP address. 

	6.   If correspondence is found, then the destination router will forwad the packet to the LAN switch in order to ultimately forward the packet to its destination device. 


      
Static vs Dynamic Routing: 

---> In routing there are 2 types of routing: static and dynamic routing. 

---> In static routing, the routes are entered manually by a network administrator into the routing tables of the network's routers.                                

	---> In this sense, the path determination of the network are pre-determined. 

	---> This means there is no extra overhead for routing and static routing is faster as a result, but also subject to more problems with larger networks. 

	---> In larger networks or networks that are subject to regular changes, the static routes must be manually changed with every change, which can become time consuming and error-prone. 

	---> Therefore, static routing is ideal for smaller networks with few routes that rarely change.                      


---> Dynamic routing is an automated form of routing that uses routing protocols to automatically populate the router's routing tables and muses metrics to make the most efficient routing path determinations. 

	---> Furthermore, in dynamic routing, the routing table of the router is automatically updated whenever the network changes. 

	---> This ensures that all routing decisions are handled by the routing protocol. 

	---> Therefore, dynamic routing is ideal for larger and more complex networks that are subject to regular change. 

	---> There are 3 main cateogories of dynamic routing protocol: 

		A. Distance-Vector => This category considers the distance between source and destination in terms of the number of routers the packet must "hop" through in order to reach the destination. 

		B. Link-State => This category considers several metrics such as the state of the connection (down or up) between routers in the network.            

			---> Other factors are also considered. 


		C. Hybrid => This category is a combination between distance-vector and link-state.
